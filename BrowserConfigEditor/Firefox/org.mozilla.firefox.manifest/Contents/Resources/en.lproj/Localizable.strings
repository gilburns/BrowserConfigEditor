You will see the ID in the Extensions section. I’ve also created an extension that makes it easy to find the ID of extensions on AMO. You can download it here.\nNote: If the extension ID is a UUID (for example {12345678-1234-1234-1234-1234567890ab}), you must include the curly braces around the ID.\nThe configuration for each extension is another dictionary that can contain the fields documented below.\nName    Description\ninstallation_mode    Maps to a string indicating the installation mode for the extension. The valid strings are allowed, blocked, force_installed, and normal_installed.\n        allowed    Allows the extension to be installed by the user. This is the default behavior. There is no need for an install_url; it will automatically be allowed based on the ID.\n        blocked    Blocks installation of the extension and removes it from the device if already installed. If used in the default (\"*\") configuration, it blocks all extensions that do not have an explicit configuration with a different installation_mode.\n        force_installed    Automatically installs the extension and prevents it from being removed by the user. This option is not valid for the default configuration and requires an install_url.\n        normal_installed    Automatically installs the extension but allows it to be disabled by the user. This option is not valid for the default configuration and requires an install_url.\ninstall_url    The URL from which Firefox can download a force_installed or normal_installed extension. Firefox automatically installs, updates, or re-installs the extension when the XPI file’s internal version changes.<ul><li>If installing from addons.mozilla.org, use https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/latest/ADDON_ID/latest.xpi and substitute ADDON_ID with the extension’s ID (for example, uBlock0@raymondhill.net or {446900e4-71c2-419f-a6a7-df9c091e268b}). Using the AMO ID ensures Firefox always downloads the latest version that matches the user’s platform.</li><li>If installing from the local file system, use a file:/// URL. Firefox will update or re-install the extension whenever the XPI file at that path changes. You can also manually trigger an update by changing the file name or path.</li><li>Language packs are available from https://releases.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/VERSION/PLATFORM/xpi/LANGUAGE.xpi (for example, https://releases.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/111.0.1/win64/xpi/en-US.xpi). These URLs can be used as install_url values for managing language pack installation.</li></ul>\ninstall_sources    A list of sources from which installing extensions is allowed using URL match patterns. This is unnecessary if you are only allowing the installation of certain extensions by ID. Each item in this list is an extension-style match pattern. Users will be able to easily install items from any URL that matches an item in this list. Both the location of the .xpi file and the page where the download is started (the referrer) must be allowed by these patterns.

If \"installation_mode\": \"blocked\" is set (either for a specific ID or for \"*\"), extensions remain blocked regardless of allowed_types. This setting can be used only for the default configuration.\nblocked_install_message    Maps to a string specifying the error message to display to users if they’re blocked from installing an extension. This setting allows you to append text to the generic error message displayed when an extension is blocked. This could be used to direct users to your help desk, explain why a particular extension is blocked, or something similar.
